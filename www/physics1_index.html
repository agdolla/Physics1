<h2>Aims and scope</h2>

<p class="noindent">There are multiple aims of this course, not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>learning the basics of kinematics, forces, torques, mechanical energies,
  momenta, continuum mechanics, and special relativity; and</li>
  <li>development of critical quantitative reasoning abilities,
  including estimation, approximation, and calculation.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The scope of the course is set by a finite set of problems.</b>
This set of problems is the union of all the problems seen or
discussed in lecture, all the problems brought up in recitation, and
all the problems given in the weekly Problem Sets (or other handouts).</p>

<p>All Exam questions on all of the Term Exams will refer only to
problems from this extremely limited set of problems.  Exam problems
will be repeats of problems seen before, with only minor changes or
transformations.</p>

<p><b>Why this scope?</b> The goal is to learn a few things deeply,
rather than cover a lot of ground. The problems you will see in this
course have been carefully chosen to (collectively) touch on all of
the important physics we need to learn, and all of the important techniques
we need to develop. By limiting the number of problems we consider, the
problem of studying for this course gets changed from cramming on a huge
corpus of textbook into deeply understanding a small number of very
rich problems.</p>

<p>There is one more reason that the course is built around problems
rather than, say, textbook sections or chapters: Each problem will
contain multiple physical concepts, which permits us to return
multiple times to common, important physical principles. Research
shows that repeated encounters with general principles, contextualized
within concrete problems, is critical to learning.</p>

<h2>Book and materials</h2>

<p><b>There is no assigned textbook</b> for the lecture component of
the course.  Any calculus-based mechanics textbook published in the
last ten years would provide an acceptable reference work.
Prof&nbsp;Hogg's favorite book in the genre is <i>Matter and Interactions Volume 1</i> by
Chabay and Sherwood (any edition).  If you want comfort and
familiarity, then
<i>University Physics Volume 1</i> by Young and Freedman (also any
edition) will probably meet your expectations.  Once again,
the scope is set by the finite set of problems, not by any
textbook.</p>

<p><b>Why no textbook?</b> This course is the beginning of your
training to think and act like a physicist, who solves physics
problems in the wild. In the wild, problems are presented to you
without textbook context and without a guide to the relevant physical
effects or equations. This means that a physicist needs to be able to
reason, do web research, use the library, and get help from colleagues,
and then assess the validity, consistency, and correctness of the
information so obtained. This training begins now. (In addition, and
relevant to all this, Prof&nbsp;Hogg's view is that essentially all of the
textbooks have significant limitations and contain substantially
misleading material; we will discuss these problems as we go.)</p>

<p>All that said, we will do some reading from Prof&nbsp;Hogg's
<a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/sr/">lecture notes on Special Relativity</a> in the last
few weeks of the semester.</p>

<p>Mathematics comprises a set of core tools for this course.
Calculus, vectors, trigonometry, and algebra will all be involved.
If you are rusty, brush up.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p class="noindent">Grades will be based on a total score generated
with these percentages:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>                    </td><th>percentage       </th></tr>
  <tr><th>all Problem Sets combined</th><td align="right"> 40</td></tr>
  <tr><th>best four Term Exams combined  </th><td align="right"> 30</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Final Exam               </th><td align="right"> 30</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>total</i>             </td><td align="right">100</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent"><i>Note:</i> The combination of all Term Exams will involve
dropping (ignoring) your lowest two Exam scores.</p>

<p>Grades will be assigned in one-to-one correspondence with the total
score according to the following percentage ranges:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>total score greater than:</th><td>80</td><td>76      </td><td>72</td><td>64</td><td>60      </td><td>56</td><td>48</td><td>30</td><th>percent</th></tr>
  <tr><th>final grade at least:    </th><td>A </td><td>A&minus;</td><td>B+</td><td>B </td><td>B&minus;</td><td>C+</td><td>C </td><td>D </td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Why these absolute grading policies?</b> Relative grading
policies (in which, say, <i>x</i> percent of the class gets an <i>A</i>) make
the student-student interactions essentially competitive. Prof&nbsp;Hogg
wants the students in this course to interact cooperatively, not
competitively. If you work with your fellow students, and everyone
does better on the Problem Sets and Exams, everyone's grade prospects
improve.</p>

<h2>Problem Sets</h2>

<p class="noindent">A small number of problems are assigned each week
to work on as you wish (see the table below).  These Problem Sets are
to be handed in for grading, according to the instructions and
deadline given on each Problem Set. The problem-set problems constitute
the core material for the course and set a large part of its scope
(see above).</p>

<p><b>Late Problem Sets (those handed in but after the deadline) will
be graded for (at most) half credit.</b> The only exceptions will be
for students with properly documented medical excuses that are germane
to late submission, or students with religious conflicts. For religious
conflicts, notify Prof Hogg <i>in advance</i>.</p>

<p>Please feel free to discuss problem-set material with other
students.  Working together can be very educational and helpful; it is
also more fun; it is encouraged! Of course it is also the case that you
will not learn the material and not perform well on the Exams if you
have not struggled individually with the problems, so seek a
balance. <b>The work you hand in on your Problem Set must be your own</b>,
in your own words and handwriting.</p>

<p><b>Why do the Problem Sets include such strange questions?</b>
Every Problem Set (and every Exam) will contain problems that require
you to obtain and use real-world information (about, say, the density
of rock) and make estimates and approximations. These problems can
make students anxious (and can be hard for the staff of this course to
grade, sometimes!). However (as noted above), this course is the first
step in training you to act and think like a physicist! A physicist
understands the real world, and at the precision that is permitted
given the data. In many cases, the deep physical insights happen at
the order-of-magnitude level!</p>

<p>Furthermore, the challenge of a
physicist is to take a big, ill-posed question (like, &ldquo;How do we
make transportation more energy efficient?&rdquo;) and break it down
into many well-posed questions (like, &ldquo;What are the relative
amounts of energy dissipated by air resistance and by braking for a
journey of a certain type, with a vehicle with certain
characteristics?&rdquo;). This conversion of ill-posed questions into well-posed
questions requires techniques of estimation and approximation that we
are beginning to learn in this course.</p>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p class="noindent">All of the teaching staff on this course
  have <b>office hours</b> (listed above), and if you can't make their
  office hours, you should feel free to contact them about the
  material of the course by email. You get <i>much more</i> out of
  office hours or even email contact if you have a <i>specific
  question</i> ready in advance.</p>

<p>The tutoring for this course (hours listed above) provides great
  opportunities to get help. Bring your questions to the tutoring, and
  be prepared to participate.</p>

<p>Importantly, your best learning resource is your fellow students.
  Form a study group (ideally with students of comparable ability) and
  work together on the lecture material, on relevant reading, and on
  the Problem Sets.  Choose a regular time and meet.  Multiple lines
  of research show that students who make use of peer support learn
  better and perform better on the Exams.  They also have more
  fun.</p>

<h2>Examinations</h2>

<p class="noindent">There will be 6 small, low-stakes Term
Examinations during the term and one Final Exam.  The Exams happen in
the last 30 minutes of class time, on dates given in the schedule
below.  The Exams will take place in the lecture room.  The scope of
each Exam will be made clear in lecture, but in brief, the Term Exams
will concentrate on the material in the previous few weeks.</p>

<p><b>Why so many Exams?</b> Research shows that students learn a full
semester of material better when they are presented with frequent,
low-stakes tests. <i>The Exams are low-stakes in that each is only worth
a small fraction of your final grade, and when they are combined for
grading, we will drop the lowest two scores among them.</i> Each Exam gives you
an opportunity to recall the material of the course, and also learn
where you need to do more work.</p>

<p>The Exams will be <b>open notes</b>.  Any written or printed
documents are permitted in the Exam room.  On the other hand,
electronic devices that can connect to a mobile-phone network or
internet are forbidden.  Furthermore, you <i>do not need a
calculator</i>, so no electronic devices will be permitted at all.</p>

<p>Each Exam question will be a small modification or extension or
generalization or specialization of a <i>problem you have seen
before,</i> in lecture, in recitation, or on a Problem Set.  The idea
is that good performance on the Exams will demonstrate that you really
have understood the work that has been assigned and discussed
throughout the semester (see comments on scope, above).</p>

<p><b>Missed Exams will be graded zero unless there is a properly
documented medical excuse or a religious conflict.</b>
If there is a properly documented
medical excuse or an announced-in-advance (to Prof Hogg) religious conflict
for a missed Term Exam, it will be pro-rated out of the
total score.  <b>No special arrangements will be made and no excuses will
be granted for travel conflicts, no matter what.</b>  If you have a
non-medical emergency or non-religious conflict that prevents you from making an Exam,
you will have to speak with a Dean of your College, not with the
staff of this course.</p>

<p>(If you are re-taking only the Exam part of this course, or have
any similar circumstance, you must contact Prof&nbsp;Hogg
at the beginning of the semester, before the first Exam, to notify him of this
situation.)</p>

<p>If you arrive late for any Exam, you will not be given extra time.
If you fail to obey any of the instructions given to you by course
staff before, during, or after any Exam, your Exam may be graded zero
or you may be subject to academic honesty proceedings.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p class="noindent"><b>respect for diversity:</b> It is
Prof&nbsp;Hogg's intent that students from all backgrounds and
perspectives be served well by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed, and that the diversity that students bring to this
class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.  Your suggestions
are encouraged and appreciated.
Please let Prof&nbsp;Hogg or the other staff of the class know if any
issues arise or how we can improve our approaches, for you personally
or for other students or for students from minoritized groups more broadly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>audio recordings:</b> While you are not
forbidden from making audio recordings during class, <i>you must not
post, publish, or share them with others</i>, not even in small sound
bites.  This is because the classroom setting is a private setting in
which everyone should feel free to speak plainly and without regrets.
Failure to obey this rule will be considered an act of academic
dishonesty.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>disabilities:</b> If you have an arrangement
with the Center for Students with Disabilities, you must present the
relevant forms to Prof&nbsp;Hogg one week in advance of each of the
Exams.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>academic honesty:</b> The lightest consequence
for academic dishonesty that Prof&nbsp;Hogg considers
consistent with University and Departmental policy is a grade
of <q>F</q> in the course and a recommended disciplinary action by the
College.  Academic dishonesty includes (in addition to the usual kinds
of cheating) misrepresenting matters of material importance to the
instructors.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>staying current:</b> It is every student's
individual responsibility to stay up-to-date with the syllabus and any
emails sent by the staff regarding the course. Having a broken email
address, having an overfull inbox, or not being registered properly
in <i>Albert</i> or <i>NYU Classes</i> will not be accepted as excuses
for missing things or not knowing about events or assignments.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>feedback:</b> Please ask questions during
lectures and recitations.  If there is something you don't understand,
many other students are having the same trouble, <i>guaranteed.</i> If
there is some aspect of the pace, content, or structure of the course
you don't like, or any other feedback you would like to give, please
let Prof&nbsp;Hogg know as soon as possible.  If you wait until course
evaluation forms are handed out at the end of the semester, you will
have benefited next year's class at the expense of your own!</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>legalese:</b> We apologize for the legal tone
of this section of the syllabus.  The subject of physics is great fun;
operating a sizeable course can be exasperating.  All of the staff of
this course will do everything we can to make this course interesting
and enjoyable for everyone.  Physics isn't just fun for
Prof&nbsp;Hogg; it is his profession and his calling.</p>
