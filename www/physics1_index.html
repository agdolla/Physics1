<h2>Aims and scope</h2>

<p class="noindent">There are multiple aims of this course, not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>learning the basics of kinematics, forces, torques, mechanical energies,
  momenta, continuum mechanics, and special relativity; and</li>
  <li>development of critical quantitative reasoning abilities,
  including estimation, approximation, and calculation.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The scope of the course is set by a finite set of problems.</b>
This set of problems is the union of all the problems seen or
discussed in lecture, all the problems brought up in recitation, and
all the problems given in the weekly problem sets (or other handouts).</p>

<p>All exam questions on all of the term exams will refer only to
problems from this extremely limited set of problems.  Exam problems
will be repeats of problems seen before, with only minor changes or
transformations.</p>

<p><b>Why this scope?</b> [HOGG WORDS HERE]</p>

<h2>Book and materials</h2>

<p><b>There is no assigned textbook</b> for the lecture component of
the course.  Any calculus-based mechanics textbook published in the
last ten years would provide an acceptable reference work.  Prof
Hogg's favorite book is <i>Matter and Interactions Volume 1</i> by
Chabay and Sherwood (any edition).  If you want comfort and
familiarity, then
<i>University Physics Volume 1</i> by Young and Freedman (also any
edition) will probably meet your expectations.  Once again,
the scope is set by the finite set of problems, not by any
textbook.</p>

<p><b>Why no textbook?</b> [HOGG WORDS HERE]</p>

<p>Vectors, calculus, trigonometry, and algebra will all be involved.
If you are rusty, brush up.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p class="noindent">Grades will be based on a total score generated
with these percentages:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>                    </td><th>percentage       </th></tr>
  <tr><th>all problem sets combined</th><td align="right"> 40</td></tr>
  <tr><th>all term exams combined  </th><td align="right"> 30</td></tr>
  <tr><th>final exam               </th><td align="right"> 30</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>total</i>             </td><td align="right">100</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Grades will be assigned in one-to-one correspondence with the total
score according to the following percentage ranges:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>total score greater than:</th><td>90</td><td>86      </td><td>82</td><td>72</td><td>68      </td><td>64</td><td>54</td><td>40</td><th>percent</th></tr>
  <tr><th>final grade at least:    </th><td>A </td><td>A&minus;</td><td>B+</td><td>B </td><td>B&minus;</td><td>C+</td><td>C </td><td>D </td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Why these absolute grading policies?</b> [HOGG WORDS HERE]</p>

<h2>Problem sets</h2>

<p class="noindent">A small number of problems are assigned each week
to work on as you wish (see the table below).  These problem sets are
to be handed in for grading.</p>

<p>Please feel free to discuss problem set questions with other
students.  Working together can be very educational and helpful; it is
also more fun; it is encouraged! Of course it is also the case that you
will not learn the material and not perform well on the exams if you
have not struggled individually with the problems, so seek a
balance.</p>

<p>The problem sets provide very valuable concrete example problems
around which you can seek help and advice from your peers and from the
tutoring and help resources we provide.  Solutions to the problems
will <i>not</i> be provided; these problem sets will be evaluated
by your performance on the term exams.</p>

<p><b>Why do the problem sets include such strange questions?</b>
[HOGG WORDS HERE].</p>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p class="noindent">All of the teaching staff on this course have <b>office hours</b>
  (listed above), and you should feel free to contact them at any time
  about the material of the course. You get <i>much more</i> out of
  office hours if you come with a <i>specific question</i> ready in
  advance.</p>

<p>Importantly, your best learning resource is your fellow students.
  Form a study group (ideally with students of comparable ability) and
  work together on the lecture material, on relevant reading, and on
  the problem sets.  Choose a regular time and meet.  Multiple lines
  of research show that students who make use of peer support learn
  better and perform better on the exams.  They also have more
  fun.</p>

<h2>Examinations</h2>

<p class="noindent">There will be XX Term Examinations during the
term and one Final Exam.  The exams happen on dates given
in the schedule below.  The exams will take place in the lecture room.
The scope of each exam will be made clear in lecture, but in brief,
the Term Exams will concentrate on the material in the previous few
weeks.</p>

<p><b>Why so many exams?</b> [HOGG WORDS HERE].</p>

<p>The Exams will be <b>open notes</b>.  Any written or printed
documents are permitted in the exam room.  On the other hand,
electronic devices that can connect to a mobile-phone network or
internet are forbidden.  Furthermore, you <i>do not need a
calculator</i>, so no electronic devices will be permitted at all.</p>

<p>Each exam question will be a small modification or extension or
generalization or specialization of a <i>problem you have seen
before,</i> in lecture, in recitation, or on a problem set.  The idea
is that good performance on the exams will demonstrate that you really
have understood the work that has been assigned and discussed
throughout the semester (see comments on scope, above).</p>

<p><b>Missed Exams will be graded zero unless there is a properly
documented medical excuse.</b> If there is a properly documented
medical excuse for a missed term exam, it will be pro-rated out of the
total score.  <i>No special arrangements will be made and no excuses will
be granted for travel conflicts, no matter what.</i>  If you have a
non-medical emergency that prevents you from making an examination,
you will have to speak with a Dean of your College, not with the
staff of this course.</p>

<p>(If you are re-taking only the Exam part of this course, or have
any similar circumstance, you must contact both Prof&nbsp;Hogg and
Mr&nbsp;LePage at the beginning of the semester to notify them of this
situation.)</p>

<p>If you arrive late for any Exam, you will not be given extra time.
If you fail to obey any of the instructions given to you by course
staff before, during, or after any Exam, your Exam may be graded zero
or you may be subject to academic honesty proceedings.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p class="noindent"><b>audio recordings:</b> While you are not
forbidden from making audio recordings during class, <i>you must not
post, publish, or share them with others</i>, not even in small sound
bites.  This is because the classroom setting is a private setting in
which everyone should feel free to speak plainly and without regrets.
Failure to obey this rule will be considered an act of academic
dishonesty.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>disabilities:</b> If you have an arrangement
with the Center for Students with Disabilities, you must present the
relevant forms to Mr&nbsp;LePage one week in advance of each of the
exams.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>academic honesty:</b> By University and
Departmental policy, the lightest punishment we are permitted to give
for academic dishonesty is a grade of <q>F</q> in the course and a
disciplinary action by the College.  Academic dishonesty includes (in
addition to the usual kinds of cheating) misrepresenting matters of
material importance to the instructors.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>staying current:</b> It is every student's
individual responsibility to stay up-to-date with the syllabus and any
emails sent by the staff regarding the course. Having a broken email
address, having an overfull inbox, or not being registered properly
in <i>Albert</i> or <i>NYU Classes</i> will not be accepted as excuses
for missing things or not knowing about events or assignments.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>feedback:</b> Please ask questions during
lectures and recitations.  If there is something you don't understand,
many other students are having the same trouble, <i>guaranteed.</i> If
there is some aspect of the pace, content, or structure of the course
you don't like, or any other feedback you would like to give, please
let Prof&nbsp;Hogg know as soon as possible.  If you wait until course
evaluation forms are handed out at the end of the semester, you will
have benefited next year's class at the expense of your own!</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>legalese:</b> We apologize for the legal tone
of this section of the syllabus.  The subject of physics is great fun;
operating a sizeable class can be exasperating.  All of the staff of
this course will do everything we can to make this class interesting
and enjoyable for everyone.  Physics isn't just fun for
Prof&nbsp;Hogg; it is his profession and his calling.</p>
