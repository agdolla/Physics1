<h2>Aims and scope</h2>

<p class="noindent">There are several aims of this course, not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>learning the basics of kinematics, forces, mechanical energies,
  and continuum mechanics (fluids and elastic materials);</li>
  <li>development of critical quantitative reasoning abilities,
  including estimation, approximation, and calculation;</li>
  <li>with a concentration on physical effects of importance in the
  life sciences and health professions.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The scope of the course is set by a finite set of problems.</b>
This set of problems is the union of all the problems seen or
discussed in lecture, all the problems seen or discussed in the
laboratory component of the course, and the set of problems given in
the weekly problem sets.</p>

<p>All exam questions on all of the term exams will refer only to
problems from this extremely limited set of problems.  Exam problems
will be repeats of problems seen before, with only minor changes or
transformations.</p>

<p><b>There is no assigned textbook</b> for the lecture component of
the course.  Any calculus-based mechanics textbook published in the
last ten years would provide an acceptable reference work.  Prof
Hogg's favorite book is <i>Matter and Interactions Volume 1</i> by
Chabay and Sherwood (any edition).  If you want comfort and
familiarity, then
<i>University Physics Volume 1</i> by Young and Freedman (also any
edition) will mesh well with what happens next semester.  Once again,
the scope is set by the finite set of problems, not by any
textbook.</p>

<p>Calculus, trigonometry, and algebra will all be involved.  If you
are rusty, brush up.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p class="noindent">Grades will be based on a total score generated
with these percentages:<br/>
<table>
  <tr><td>                    </td><th>percentage       </th><th>comments</th></tr>
  <tr><th>laboratory reports  </th><td align="right"> 20</td><td><i>lowest lab grade is dropped</i></td></tr>
  <tr><th>term exam 1         </th><td align="right"> 20</td></tr>
  <tr><th>term exam 2         </th><td align="right"> 20</td></tr>
  <tr><th>term exam 3         </th><td align="right"> 20</td></tr>
  <tr><th>term exam 4         </th><td align="right"> 20</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>total</i>        </td><td align="right">100</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Grades will be assigned in one-to-one correspondence with the total
score according to the following percentage ranges:<br/>
<table>
  <tr><th>total score greater than:</th><td>90</td><td>86      </td><td>82</td><td>72</td><td>68      </td><td>64</td><td>54</td><td>40</td><th>percent</th></tr>
  <tr><th>final grade at least:    </th><td>A </td><td>A&minus;</td><td>B+</td><td>B </td><td>B&minus;</td><td>C+</td><td>C </td><td>D </td></tr>
</table></p>

<h2>Laboratories</h2>

<p class="noindent">For the laboratory component of this course, you
will need the <a
href="http://physics.nyu.edu/~physlab/GenPhysI_PhysII/genphys1.html"><i>General
Physics I laboratory manual</i></a>.  There are
laboratory sessions for most weeks of the semester, and for each one
you will be required to hand in a laboratory report, which will be
graded.  Your laboratory instructor will explain what is expected in a
good laboratory report.</p>

<p>Laboratory reports are due at the start of the laboratory session
immediately following the session in which the experiment is
performed.  A late reports is penalized by reducing the maximum
possible grade by 50 percentage points if it comes in within a week of
the deadline; it is graded zero after that.</p>

<p>Absences from laboratories will be excused only for medical reasons
with a doctor's note.  No other excuses will be accepted.  It is not
possible to perform a laboratory experiment in advance of the
scheduled laboratory time or after it.  Laboratory experiments missed
or reports not turned in for any reason will be graded zero unless
there is a properly documented medical excuse.  Importantly, <b>if you
miss or get a grade of zero on more than two laboratory experiments
for any reason (medical or otherwise)</b>, you will not receive a
passing grade for the course; the best grade you can receive in this
situation is "Incomplete".  You can only complete this incomplete by
retaking the <i>entire</i> lab sequence (not just the labs you missed)
in a subsequent semester.</p>

<p>If you are re-taking only the laboratory part of this course, you
must contact both Prof&nbsp;Hogg and Mr&nbsp;LePage at the beginning
of the semester to notify them of this situation, and you must be
properly registered for the laboratory session you attend.</p>

<p>Your laboratory instructor will be responsible for grading your
laboratory reports and for providing to Prof&nbsp;Hogg a laboratory
grade for each student.  Your instructor will construct your total
laboratory grade from all but your worst (lowest-score) laboratory.
If you have missed a laboratory for a properly documented medical
reason, that laboratory will be pro-rated out of the total score.  (If
you have missed more than two for any reason, including medical, you
will not pass the course; see above.) If we find that there are large
and statistically significant differences in the grading policies or
outcomes of different laboratory instructors, Prof&nbsp;Hogg will make
adjustments in the interest of fairness.</p>

<p>For safety reasons, <b>you are not permitted to attend a laboratory
session for which you are not registered</b>, even if it is led by the
same instructor as your proper session.  Laboratory reports based on
attendance in wrong laboratory sessions will be given scores of
zero.</p>

<h2>Problem sets</h2>

<p class="noindent">A small number of problems are assigned each week
to work on as you wish (see the table below).  These problem sets are
not to be handed in, but it is strongly recommended that you work on
the problems, because they comprise part of the scope of the
course.</p>

<p>Please feel free to discuss problem set questions with other
students.  Working together can be very educational and helpful; it is
also more fun; it is encouraged!  Of course it is also the case that
you will not learn the material and not perform well on the exams if
you have not struggled individually with the problems, so seek a
balance.</p>

<p>The problem sets provide very valuable concrete example problems
around which you can seek help and advice from your peers and from the
tutoring and help resources we provide.  Solutions to the problems
will <i>not</i> be provided; these problem sets will be evaluated
by your performance on the term exams.</p>

<h2>Tutoring and help</h2>

<p class="noindent">The Department and University provide tremendous
resources for this class; you are doing yourself a disservice if you
do not use them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Department provides a <b>custom peer-tutoring service</b>
  for this class, staffed by some of the best Physics Majors.  The
  locations and hours for this tutoring will be available on
  BlackBoard.</li>
  <li>The <b>University Learning Center</b> has special tutors
  hired for <i>General Physics</i>, all of whom have taken the class
  (or equivalent) and done very well.  Locations, hours, and policies
  are available at <a href="http://learning.cas.nyu.edu/">the ULC
  site</a>.</li>
  <li>All of the staff have <b>office hours</b> (listed above), and
  you should feel free to contact them at any time about the material
  of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these resources has the important property that you
get <i>much more</i> out of them if you come with a <i>specific
question</i> ready in advance.</p>

<p>But above all, your best resource is your fellow students.  Form a
study group (ideally with students of comparable ability) and work
together on the lecture material, on relevant reading, and on the
problem sets.  Choose a regular time and meet.  Multiple lines of
research show that students who make use of peer support learn better
and perform better on the exams.  They also have more fun.</p>

<h2>Examinations</h2>

<p class="noindent">There will be four Term Examinations during the
term and <i>no Final Exam</i>.  The Term Exams happen on dates given
in the schedule below.  The exams will take place in the lecture room.
The scope of each exam will be made clear in lecture, but in brief,
the Term Exams will concentrate on the material in the previous few
weeks.</p>

<p>The exams will be <b>open notes</b>.  Any written or printed
documents are permitted in the exam room.  On the other hand,
electronic devices that can connect to a mobile-phone network or
internet are forbidden.  Furthermore, you <i>do not need a
calculator</i>, so no electronic devices will be permitted at all.</p>

<p>Each exam question will be a small modification of a <i>problem you
have seen before,</i> in lecture, in a laboratory, or on a problem
set, with small changes or shortened to a sub-part of the problem.
The idea is that good performance on the exams will demonstrate that
you really have understood the work that has been assigned and
discussed throughout the semester.</p>

<p><b>Missed exams will be graded zero unless there is a properly
documented medical excuse.</b> If there is a properly documented
medical excuse for a missed term exam, it will be pro-rated out of the
total score.  No special arrangements will be made and no excuses will
be granted for travel conflicts, no matter what.  If you have a
non-medical emergency that prevents you from making an examination,
you will have to speak with a Dean of your College, not with the
faculty in this course.</p>

<p>The exams are absolutely mandatory.  <b>If you miss or do not take
or do not hand in more than one of the Term Exams for any reason</b>
(medical or otherwise), you will not receive a passing grade for the
course; the best grade you can receive in this situation
is <q>Incomplete</q>.  You can only complete this incomplete by
retaking the <i>entire</i> exam complement (not just the exams you
missed, and possibly including a Final Exam) in a subsequent
semester.</p>

<p>If you are re-taking only the exam part of this course, you
must contact both Prof&nbsp;Hogg and Mr&nbsp;LePage at the beginning
of the semester to notify them of this situation.</p>

<p>If you arrive late for any exam, you will not be given extra time.
If you fail to obey any of the instructions given to you by course
staff before, during, or after any exam, your exam may be graded zero
or you may be subject to academic honesty proceedings.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p class="noindent"><b>audio recordings:</b> While you are not
forbidden from making audio recordings during class, <b>you must not
post, publish, or share them with others</b>, not even in small sound
bites.  This is because the classroom setting is a private setting in
which everyone should feel free to speak plainly and without regrets.
Failure to obey this rule will be considered an act of academic
dishonesty.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>disabilities:</b> If you have an arrangement
with the Center for Students with Disabilities, you must present the
relevant forms to Mr&nbsp;LePage one week in advance of each of the
exams.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>academic honesty:</b> By University and
Departmental policy, the lightest punishment we are permitted to give
for academic dishonesty is a grade of <q>F</q> in the course and a
disciplinary action by the College.  Academic dishonesty includes (in
addition to the usual kinds of cheating) misrepresenting matters of
material importance to the instructors.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>feedback:</b> Please ask questions during
lectures and laboratory sections and help sessions.  If there is something you don't understand,
many other students are having the same trouble, <i>guaranteed.</i> If
there is some aspect of the pace, content, or structure of the course
you don't like, or any other feedback you would like to give, please
let Prof&nbsp;Hogg know as soon as possible.  If you wait until course
evaluation forms are handed out at the end of the semester, you will
have benefited next year's class at the expense of your own!</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>legalese:</b> We apologize for the legal tone
of this syllabus.  The subject of physics is great fun; operating an
enormous class can be exasperating.  All of the staff of this course
will do everything we can to make this class interesting and enjoyable
for everyone.  Physics isn't just fun for Prof&nbsp;Hogg; it is his
profession and his calling.</p>
