\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
When you weigh yourself on a scale, you weigh less than your
gravitational force, because there is a buoyant-force correction. What
fraction of your weight is this correction? That is, what is the
buoyant force divided by the gravitational force, roughly?
(from Problem Set 9)

A figure skater spins in place on frictionless ice at angular speed
$\omega_i$ with hands outstretched. The skater has a total moment of inertia
$I_i$. As the skater draws his hands into his body, his moment of
inertia decreases to $I_f$ = $I_i/2$. Does the kinetic energy $K$
increase, decrease, or stay the same? Assume that there are no torques
acting.
(from Problem Set 10)

Immediately after being hit by the cue, a cue ball slides along the
felt in the $x$ direction at speed $v$. Draw a free-body diagram for
the cue ball, showing the forces acting, and clearly label the $x$
direction.
(from Problem Set 10)

What would be the length of an Earth year if the Earth was orbiting
on a circular orbit of radius $0.25\,\AU$ (instead of $1\,\AU$)?
Give your answer in units of days.

What is the relationship between linear acceleration $a$ and
angular acceleration $\alpha$ when a ball of radius $R$ is rolling
without slipping down a plane?
