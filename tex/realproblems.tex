\textsl{(a)}~What is the maximum amount of cash you can obtain by
successfully robbing an armored truck?  Assume that it is packed with
twenties; that is, estimate an answer by considering the volume of the
truck, and (harder to estimate) the volume of a 20-dollar bill.  State
your assumptions and explain your work, but please don't attempt an
experiment.  Be sure to explain exactly how you estimated the volume
of a 20-dollar bill.  \emph{Hint: think of a stack of bills to
  estimate the volume.  Feel free to \emph{check} any part of your
  answer on the internet, but make sure you actually make a justified,
  quantitative estimate independently.}

\textsl{(b)}~Do you think that many of the armored trucks in Manhattan
are fully packed with 20-dollar bills?

\textsl{(c)}~Would a similar truck weigh more, less, or about the same
if it contained the same amount of money but in the form of gold bars
instead of 20-dollar bills?

What is the mean acceleration $a$ of a dragster (ie, a drag-racing
automobile) that can travel 1/4~mi in 5.5~s, starting from a dead
stop?  Assume that the dragster accelerates with constant acceleration
throughout the 5.5~s (not a terrible assumption, but not a good one
either).  Give your answer in terms of the gravitational acceleration
$g$.  Does your answer seem reasonable?  What do you predict, under
the constant-acceleration assumption, for the final speed
$v_\mathrm{f}$ of the dragster as it crosses the finish line?  Give
your answer in $\mathrm{mi\,h^{-1}}$.  Search the WWW for the current
world-record 1/4~mi drag-race time and final speed.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
A bit on air resistance and terminal velocities. If you want more
discussion of these issues, see \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0107}
(click the PDF link at the right of the page).

\textsl{(a)}~Show that the ram-pressure-force formula $\rho\,A\,v^2$ has the
correct units to be a force, when $\rho$ is a mass density, $A$ is a
cross-sectional area, and $v$ is a speed. Look up air drag on
Wikipedia and see what this formula is missing.

\textsl{(b)}~At what downward falling speed $v$ does an object with
mass $M$ and cross-sectional area $A$ find that ram pressure balances
the gravitational force? Derive an expression. This is the formula
(ish) for the terminal velocity!

\textsl{(c)}~Two pennies are dropped (carefully) from a tall building,
one so that it falls precisely edge-on, and one so that it falls
precisely face-on (difficult but not impossible in practice).  What
(roughly) are the two terminal velocities and what (roughly) is
their ratio $v_{\mathrm{edge}}/v_{\mathrm{face}}$?

\textsl{(d)}~Roughly how far does a typical American car have to drive
to ``sweep up'' or drive through a column of air that is comparable in
weight to the car itself?  You will have to estimate the
cross-sectional area and weight of a typical car (or look both things
up on the web; if you look them up, give the make and model).

\textsl{(e)}~Describe in words the \emph{environmental significance}
of the distance you calculated in part \textsl{(d)} of the previous
problem.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}

\textsl{(a)}~Imagine a stone thrown upwards at $5~\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$.
How far does it travel in the first 0.1~s after the throw?
Approximate its velocity as being constant during that 0.1~s interval.

\textsl{(b)}~In a coordinate system in which the $x$ direction points
upwards, the stone's $x$-direction velocity $v_x(t)$ is given
(approximately) by
\begin{equation}
v_x(t)= [5~\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}]-[10~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}]\,t \quad ,
\label{eq:stone_velocity}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time since the throw (implicitly, the throw was at
$t=0$).  What is the new velocity of the stone at time
$t=0.1~\mathrm{s}$, and how far does it travel in the \emph{next}
0.1~s of its travel?  Again, approximate the velocity as being
constant during the interval.

\textsl{(c)}~Now make a table of times, 0.0~s, 0.1~s, 0.2~s, etc, all
the way to 1.5~s.  At each time, compute the velocity of the stone,
using equation (\ref{eq:stone_velocity}), and compute the
$x$-direction displacement $\Delta x$ traveled in that interval.  Sum
up the intervals to get the total displacement $x$ traveled, starting
at $x=0$ at time $t=0$.  Approximate the velocity as being constant in
each interval.  Be sure to maintain the \emph{signs} of the
displacements; sometimes the stone will be rising and sometimes it
will be falling!

\textsl{(d)}~When, according to your chart, does the stone return to
$x=0$?  Does your answer agree, roughly, with an exact calculation?
Explain any discrepancy.

Lifting strength---measured in units of force---is roughly
proportional to the cross-sectional area of your legs (or arms).  Now
imagine that you have a near-identical twin, who is incredibly similar
to you except 1 percent smaller in every linear dimension.  By what
factor $f_s$ will her or his lifting strength differ from yours?  Who
can lift more?  By what factor $f_w$ will her or his weight differ
from yours?  Who can lift a greater fraction of her or his own weight?
Ants can lift objects much heavier than themselves.  Do your answers
shed light on this ``amazing'' fact?

If you stand on the equator of the Earth, you are not really standing
still but rather rotating around the center of the Earth once every 24
hours.  What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration
$a_\mathrm{c}$ associated with this rotation?  Give your answer as a
fraction of the gravitational acceleration $g$.

Draw, on graph paper, the curves of one-dimensional acceleration $a_x$
and position $x$, corresponding to this curve of a particle's velocity
$v_x$:
\\ \rule{0.1\textwidth}{0pt}
\resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../pro/velocity_time.eps}}
\\
Assume that the particle begins at position $x=0$ at time $t=0$.  Make
your figures as quantitatively accurate as you can, and be sure to
clearly specify and label the axes of your two plots.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
In a 200-m race, the winner crosses the halfway mark (ie, 100~m) at
$t_{1/2}=10.12$~s and the finish line at $t_{\rm f}=19.32$~s.  If you
make a kinematic model of the runner's behavior as (i)~constant
acceleration $a$ from rest for the period $0<t<t_a$ followed by
(ii)~constant speed $v=a\,t_a$ during the period $t_a<t<t_{\rm f}$,
what are $a$ and $t_a$?

\emph{Hint: Draw a graph of $v(t)$ before you start writing equations.}

\emph{Hint: Once you have a graph, consider the question: is $t_a$
going to be before or after $t_{1/2}$?  Make a quantitative argument.}

\emph{Hint: You can solve this problem with geometry and the graph; no
  need to do calculus!}

If you apply the brakes strongly, about how quickly can you stop a
typical automobile travelling at $60~\mathrm{mi\,h^{-1}}$?  Give an
answer in seconds.  If you don't drive, talk to someone who does.  The
automobile stops by applying a horizontal frictional force to the
ground.  Estimate the magnitude of the total frictional force $F_f$
required by this stop.  Give your answer both in Newtons and in
pounds.  You will have to estimate the mass of a typical automobile.
What is the direction of the frictional force applied by the
automobile to the ground?  What is the direction of the force applied
by the ground to the automobile?  Compute also the stopping distance,
ie, the distance traveled during the deceleration.  Give your answer
in meters.

The sine and cosine functions can be defined \emph{completely} by the
four constraints
\begin{equation}
\sin 0=0 \quad ;\quad
\cos 0=1 \quad ;\quad
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sin\theta}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=\cos\theta \quad ;\quad
\frac{\mathrm{d}\cos\theta}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=-\sin\theta \quad .
\nonumber
\end{equation}
We are going to approximate these equations with a chart like the one
we made for \problemname Set~1.

\textsl{(a)}~Compute approximate values for $\sin (0.1~\mathrm{rad})$
and $\cos (0.1~\mathrm{rad})$ by starting with the initial conditions
given above, approximating the derivative of $\sin$ to be constant and
equal to $\cos (0)$, and approximating the derivative of $\cos$ to be
constant and equal to $-\sin (0)$.

\textsl{(b)}~Compute approximate values for $\sin (0.2~\mathrm{rad})$
and $\cos (0.2~\mathrm{rad})$ by starting with what you computed in
part~(a), approximating the derivative of $\sin$ to be constant and
equal to the $\cos (0.1~\mathrm{rad})$ that you computed in part~(a),
and approximating the derivative of $\cos$ to be constant and equal to
the $-\sin (0.1~\mathrm{rad})$ you also computed in part~(a).  Do not
use your calculator!

\textsl{(c)}~Continue the above, computing, approximately, $\sin$ and
$\cos$, on a grid of angles 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, \ldots, $2.0~\mathrm{rad}$.
You may use a calculator, but you must not ever use either the
\fbox{$\sin$} button nor the \fbox{$\cos$} button.

\textsl{(d)}~Obtain an approximate value for $\pi/2$ by linearly
interpolating to the point at which your approximation of $\cos$
crosses zero.  Explain any discrepancy you get from the true value.
Suggest two ways you could you have improved your calculation.

Imagine a hypothetical package delivery system that involves launching
packages horizontally so fast that they travel on circular orbits just
skimming above the Earth's surface.  Imagine that the system operates
in evacuated tunnels, so air resistance can be ignored.  How fast $v$
does a package of mass $M$ have to be launched horizontally so that
the gravitational force $F_g$ on the package is just sufficient to
keep it on a uniform, circular orbit, with the center of the Earth at
the center of the orbit?  Give your answer in terms of the radius of
the Earth $R_E$, the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and anything
else you need.  How long $T$ does it take for the package to do a
complete orbit?  Again, give a symbolic expression.  When you are
done, plug in numbers and compare with the orbital period of the Space
Shuttle (look it up on the \textsc{www}).  Did you expect the period
of the Space Shuttle be more similar or more different from the period
of the package, or does it seem about right?

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Imagine a package of mass $M$ sitting on the floor of an elevator that
is accelerating upwards at acceleration $a$. The acceleration due to
gravity is $g$.

\textsl{(a)} Draw the free-body diagram for the package.

\textsl{(b)} What is the magnitude $N$ of the normal force on the
package?

\textsl{(c)} Answer those same two questions again, but with the
elevator accelerating \emph{downwards} at acceleration $a$.

\textsl{(d)} Answer those same two questions again, but with the
elevator accelerating downwards at acceleration $g$ (that is, at
the gravitational acceleration).

\textsl{(e)} In lecture Prof Hogg did a stunt with a coffee cup and a
quarter. Draw the free-body diagram for the quarter when it was at the
top of the arc (that is, when it was directly overhead).

Explain why the astronauts in the Space Shuttle are ``weightless''.
Is it because there is no gravitational force in outer space?  No, it
certainly is not!

Why is it that flying airplanes must bank (ie, tilt) to turn?  Why
can't they simply turn horizontally like an automobile can?

Imagine that a typical power line in the countryside is made of copper
wire of about 0.5~cm diameter, stretched horizontally from telephone
pole to telephone pole, with the poles separated by about 30~m.  The
wire sags by about 10~deg below the horizontal where it is attached to
each pole (because the wire is pulled down by gravity).  What is the
approximate tension $T$ in the wire?  You will need to know the
density of copper.  Draw a free-body diagram for one 30-m segment of
the wire.  Clearly state any simplifying assumptions you choose to
make.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}
\refstepcounter{problem}

A thin, uniform beam of mass $m_\mathrm{b}$ and length $L_x$ is
attached to a wall by a pivot and a wire, as shown.  The beam supports
a sign of mass $m_\mathrm{s}$.
\\ \rule{0.35\textwidth}{0pt}
\resizebox{0.3\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../mp/hanging_sign.eps}}
\\
Find the tensions $T_1$ and $T_2$ in the two wires and the vector
force $\vec{F}$ on the beam at the pivot, in terms of the quantities
shown and the acceleration $g$ due to gravity.  Assume that the pivot
is frictionless (so it provides no torque) and that the wires are
massless.  If there was friction on the pivot, what parts of your
answer would change, and in which direction?

To a good approximation, the air resistance force $F_\mathrm{air}$
acting on a moving car can be computed simply from the density $\rho$
(mass per volume) of air, the speed $v$ of the car, and the
cross-sectional area $A$ of the car.  Use a dimensional argument to
estimate the air resistance force (in Newtons) acting on a typical car
driving at $55~\mathrm{mi\,hr^{-1}}$.  You will need to say what you
are assuming for the density of air $\rho$ and the cross-sectional
area $A$ of the car.  Reasonable estimates are preferred to
unreasonable ones!

Calculate the force $F$ at which the machine illustrated below can be
pulled such that mass $m_2$ neither falls nor rises.  All surfaces are

\emph{Hint: Draw all free body diagrams and work out all kinematic
relationships before trying to solve anything!}

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
NYC had a hot summer in 2016, with most buildings running air
conditioning on a thermostat continuously. To save energy, NYU asked
their employees to conserve energy in various ways, some of which we
might take issue with. Here's an uncontroversial one: You should take
the stairs, not the elevator.

\emph{But is that uncontroversial?}  In the parts that follow, make
sure you are explicit about your assumptions, and that your
assumptions are reasonable. If you are concerned with reasonableness,
do some experiments and make some observations.

\textsl{(a)} How much potential energy does a typical NYU employee
generate if he or she climbs 10 stories of stairs?

\textsl{(b)} How fast does a healthy, young (say 30s), typically abled
NYU employee climb this many stairs?

\textsl{(c)} Compare the kinetic energy of the employee while climbing
to the potential energy gain. Which dominates our considerations?

\textsl{(d)} What is the average horsepower mechanical output of this
NYU employee steadily climbing stairs? Why do you not need to consider
the kinetic energy \emph{at all} in this part, and that ignoring it
isn't even an approximation?

\textsl{(e)} For every kcal (look up the calorie and the kcal; what
are called ``calories'' in nutrition are actually kcal) of mechanical
energy generated, a healthy, fit human also generates about 7 times
more in metabolic load; that is, you burn some 8 times your
mechanically computed power in food calories. How many kcal did the
employee burn going up the 10 stories?

\textsl{(f)} Now imagine (correctly) that all that metabolic energy
gets dumped into the building atmosphere and needs to get corrected by
the building air conditioning. Air-conditioning units are very
inefficient; they produce multiple BTU (or kcal or J or kWh) of heat
for every BTU (or kcal or J or kWh) of cooling they do. Look up
efficiencies for typical AC systems and figure out what load an
employee puts on the AC by climbing this far.

\textsl{(g)} [Not for credit!] For \emph{extremely deep reasons}, an
elevator can't be perfectly efficient either. Can you think of some of
these reasons? Prof Hogg knows at least three unbeatable physical
constraints. The relevant question for us is: Does an elevator burn
more than eight times the mechanical work it is doing, and does it
drop that load inside the building AC system? If you want, do some
research to understand this. The ``nicest'' assumption you can make
about the elevators is that they are always crowded, so you are only
looking at the \emph{marginal} cost of bringing up one more person.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Gasoline and olive oil are both substances with great chemical energy
content per unit mass.

\textsl{(a)} In the case of gasoline, the chemical energy is mainly in
carbon bonds.  If you assume that gasoline is \emph{entirely} carbon
atoms, and each one releases $4\,\eV$ of energy when it is combusted, how
much energy per unit mass is there in gasoline?  Get an answer in MJ
per kg and compare to what you find on \textit{Wikipedia}.  How far off
are our assumptions?

\textsl{(b)} Now convert your answer to kcal per g and compare it to
what is written on the ``Nutrition Facts'' label on an olive oil
bottle.  How close are you?  It should be close, (Prof Hogg thinks), because
biofuel is made from things like olive oil!

\textsl{(c)} Now assume that a car moving at speed
$v=75\,\mi\,\h^{-1}$ encounters an air resistance force of
$\rho\,A\,v^2$, where $\rho$ is the density of air and $A$ is the
cross-sectional area of the car, about $2.5\,\m^2$ How much work does it
take to move the car $30\,\mi$ at this speed?

\textsl{(d)} If a car with these properties was \emph{perfectly
  efficient}, how many miles per gallon would it get?  What does this
make you think about the future of cars that are \emph{far more
  efficient} than cars we have today?

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Here is a non-trivial machine that delivers a kind of mechanical
advantage:
\\ \rule{0.33\textwidth}{0pt}
\resizebox{0.33\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../mp/tackle_blocks.pdf}}

\textsl{(a)}~Draw free-body diagrams for all the masses and pulleys in
this mechanism. Assume that the strings and pulleys are light and
frictionless, so that the strings are perfect tension-transmitters.

\textsl{(b)} What is the kinematic constraint---the relationship
between the accelerations of block 1 and block 2? Be very careful with
this one. Treat all the strings as inextensible for simplicity.

\textsl{(c)} Find the tensions in all three strings and the
accelerations of the two blocks.

\textsl{(d)}~Now set the mass $m_2$ to the value it must have if the
system is to be perfectly ``balanced''; that is, for there to be no
net acceleration of either block.  In this situation, if block $m_1$
is lowered a small distance $h$, what is the net change in potential
energy, accounting for the displacements of both blocks?

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}
\refstepcounter{problem}

Two blocks of mass $M$ are placed on an inclined plane, inclined at an
angle $\theta$ to the horizontal.  One has a small coefficient of
sliding friction $\mu_\mathrm{k}$ that is insufficient to keep it from
accelerating down the plane.  Compute the magnitude of the frictional
force $f_\mathrm{k}$ and the magnitude of the block's acceleration
$a$.  The other block has a large coefficient of static friction
$\mu_\mathrm{s}$ that is sufficient to keep it from sliding.  Compute
the magnitude of the frictional force $f_\mathrm{s}$ acting on this
static block.  If your answer is correct, the coefficient
$\mu_\mathrm{s}$ does not appear in the expression.  Explain why not.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}
\refstepcounter{problem}

A typical American car gets about $25~\mathrm{mi\,gal^{-1}}$, driving
at a constant speed of $55~\mathrm{mi\,h^{-1}}$ on level ground.
Since the car is neither climbing nor accelerating, the power put out
by the motor is simply fighting friction and air resistance (drag).
Use these two facts to derive the total force (friction plus drag)
against which the motor is acting.  Give your answer in Newtons.
Useful facts include: (1)~the molecular weight of gasoline is roughly
$100~\mathrm{amu}$ (ie, a typical gasoline molecule is about 100 times
the mass of a hydrogen atom); (2)~gasoline is slightly less dense than
water (but not far less dense); (3)~the typical amount of energy
released when a single gasoline molecule is burned is a few eV, or,
say $5\times 10^{-19}~\mathrm{J}$; and (4)~a typical car is probably
only about 25~percent efficient in its conversion of chemical energy
into mechanical energy.  Compute the mechanical power being exerted
against friction and drag at $55~\mathrm{mi\,h^{-1}}$ in horsepower
(you might have to look up the conversion on the WWW).  Compare that
horsepower to the rated horsepower of some typical American cars.
Does your answer seem reasonable?

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}
\refstepcounter{problem}

A turn in a road, with a radius of curvature $R=150~\mathrm{m}$, is
banked at an angle $\theta$, optimized for travel at
$55~\mathrm{mi\,h^{-1}}$.  What is that angle $\theta$?  Now imagine
that on a rainy day the coefficient of static friction between a car's
tires and the road is 0.5.  What is the maximum speed $v_\mathrm{max}$
at which the car can take the turn?  Be sure to draw a very clear
free-body diagram for the car.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}

Give estimated values (in SI units) for (a)~the kinetic energies, and
(b)~the momenta of: (1)~a bullet fired from a rifle, (2)~a soccer ball
kicked hard, and (3)~a three-year-old riding slowly on a tricycle.
You will have to make estimates of the masses and speeds of all three.
Clearly state your assumptions and estimates.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
A student of mass $m_\mathrm{student}=80\,\kg$ stands at rest next to
a block of ice of mass $m_\mathrm{ice}=320\,\kg$, also at rest, on a
frictionless frozen lake.  The student pushes on the block until the
block is moving away from the student at $1.5\,\mps$ (that is, until
$\left|\vec{v}_\mathrm{ice}-\vec{v}_\mathrm{student}\right|=1.5\,\mps$).
How much work did the student do?  Give your answer in $\J$.  Don't
forget to conserve linear momentum!  \emph{Hint:} All that work went into
kinetic energy.  \emph{Another hint:} One of the hard things about
this problem is that I am giving you the \emph{relative} velocity and
not the absolute velocity.  How are you going to deal with that?
Spend some time visualizing the problem before writing equations.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}
\refstepcounter{problem}

A block of mass $5~\mathrm{kg}$ moving initially at speed
$7~\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ in the positive $x$ direction collides
elastically with another block of mass $2~\mathrm{kg}$ moving
initially at speed $2~\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ in the negative $x$
direction.  If the blocks recoil in the $x$ direction (ie, if the
problem remains one-dimensional), what are the final velocities of the
blocks?  Assume that there is no friction, drag or any other external
force.

\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
A machine at a packaging facility places stationary packages of mass
$m$ onto a horizontal conveyor belt that is moving packages steadily
and horizontally at speed $v$. Once placed on the belt, the packages
start moving at speed $v$; that is, they are rapidly accelerated.

\textsl{(a)} What is the momentum change for each package as it
gets placed on to the belt, and what is the kinetic energy change?

\textsl{(b)} Imagine that the machine places packages steadily onto
the belt, with time intervals $T$ between packages. Compute the
average mechanical power required by the belt by dividing the kinetic
energy per package by the time interval between packages.

\textsl{(c)} Now compute the average force the belt is applying to the
packages by dividing the momentum per package by the time interval
between packages. This is possible, because momentum is force per unit
time (if that is a surprise, do some library or web research).

\textsl{(d)} Power is force times velocity (dot product, really); so
the force answer can be turned into a power answer and compared to the
power you computed above.

\textsl{(e)} Do you have a discrepancy? If so, why? Which answer is
more correct?

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem}
\refstepcounter{problem}

\textsl{(a)} A bullet of mass $m$ initially traveling in the $x$
direction at high speed $v$ hits and imbeds itself in a block of mass
$M$ initially at rest.  What is the final speed $v'$ of the block,
now of mass $M+m$?  How much kinetic energy $\Delta K$ was lost in the
collision, if any?

\textsl{(b)} If the block was initially hanging from the ceiling by a
very light, long, inextensible string of length $\ell$, to what height
$\Delta h$ does the block rise (swing up) after the collision?

\textsl{(c)} Explain, very concisely, why you solved part (a) with
conservation of momentum, and part (c) with conservation of energy,
and not the other way around.

\textsl{(d)} Explain, very consisely, why you were allowed to treat
the collision part of the problem separately from the swinging part of
the problem.  Why can you approximate the collision as being finished
before it starts to swing?  \textit{Hint: Try comparing timescales.}

Re-do \problemname~\ref{elastic}, but now for the left-hand block having
mass $M$ and the right-hand block having mass $m\ll M$; that is, solve
the extreme mass-ratio problem. For initial velocities, use $v$ for
the big block and $0$ for the small block. Then draw the before and
after pictures in the lab and center-of-mass frames, just as you did

In a gas of (absolute) temperature $T$, the average-square speeds
$\left<v_x^2\right>$, $\left<v_y^2\right>$, and $\left<v_z^2\right>$
in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions are each roughly given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\,m\,\left<v_x^2\right> =
\frac{1}{2}\,m\,\left<v_y^2\right> =
\frac{1}{2}\,m\,\left<v_z^2\right> =
\frac{1}{2}\,k\,T \nonumber \;\;\; ,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant.  Air is primarily made up of
$\mathrm{N_2}$ gas.  What is the typical speed of an air molecule at
room temperature?  How does it compare to the speed of sound?  What is
the typical magnitude of the impulse $\Delta\vec{p}$ of a collision of
a $\mathrm{N_2}$ molecule with your hand?  If your hand is feeling
$15~\mathrm{lb\,in^{-2}}$ of pressure, how many molecules, roughly,
are hitting your hand every second?

\textit{You will have to look up $k$, the mass of a $N_2$ molecule (or
a N atom), the absolute temperature $T$ of room temperature, and the
speed of sound.  The rest you should calculate, and show your work.
Your answers need not be precise!}

You can model the force of the wind on a sailboat's sail as being from
elastic collisions of air molecules against the surface of the sail.
Treat the air molecules as all having the same momentum $\vec{p}_i$
and the sail as a perfectly flat surface of area $A$ with normal
vector $\hat{n}$.

\textsl{(a)} Show that the number of molecules of air hitting the sail
per unit time is proportional to the cosine of the angle $\theta$
between the normal vector $\hat{n}$ and the wind momentum $\vec{p}_i$.
Check your answer for $\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pi/2$.

\textsl{(b)} Show that the impulse $\Delta\vec{p}$ of each air
molecule collision is also proportional in magnitude to $\cos\theta$,
and that the direction of $\Delta\vec{p}$ is normal to the sail

In Problem Set 3 you computed the speed of a package delivery system
involving packages on orbits around the Earth.  Imagine that the
packages are launched using rockets that expel their propellant at
about the speed of sound (relative to the rocket).  What must be the
ratio of the mass of propellant to the mass of the package in order
for the rockets to get the packages onto their correct orbits?  If the
propellant costs the same amount per pound as gasoline, how much would
it cost to get your textbook onto the orbit?  Compare this to the
price of an overnight delivery service.  Why is the speed of sound the
relevant speed for the propellant?  Do you expect the speed of sound
in rocket propellant (which is hot) to be higher or lower than the
speed of sound in normal air?  If your rocket can expel its exhaust at
ten times the speed of sound, by how much does that reduce or increase
your costs?
