\paragraph{Extra Problem (will not be graded for credit):}%
\textsl{(a)}~Forgetting about Special Relativity, and assuming just
Newtonian mechanics, compute how long you would have to accelerate at
acceleration $g=10\,\mpss$ in order to reach the speed of light.

\textsl{(b)}~A relativistically correct contstant-acceleration
trajectory on a spacetime diagram is a hyperbola, where both
asymptotes are 45-degree lines (null trajectories. Find a formula
(position $x$ as a function of time $t$) for this hyperbola,
constrained to have acceleration $g$ at small times.

\textsl{(c)}~Show that this trajectory is unchanged under the Lorentz
transformation. That is, show that if you boost in the $x$ direction,
the trajectory translates onto itself (except, possibly, for a small
shift in the $x$ or $t$ direction).
