does it take to go 100 km? A gallon is about 4 liters, and a mile is
about 1.6 km.

Consider a stone thrown (at $t=0$) precisely upwards (in the $y$
direction, for definiteness) at $1.0\,\m\,\s^{-1}$, with an initial

very careful plot of the vertical velocity $v_y$ of the stone as a
function of time $t$ for the duration $0<t<0.3\,\s$. Use
$g=10\,\m\,\s^{-2}$.

A block of mass $m$ is placed gently on an inclined
plane, inclined at an angle $\theta=15\,\deg$ to the horizontal. The

A heavy package of $300\,\kg$ is
dragged $4\,\m$ horizontally across a surface by a horizontal
rope. The coefficient of sliding friction is $\mu = 0.2$. How much
heat is generated by this?  Assume $g = 10\,\mpss$, and give your

An elastic ball of mass $m$ heads at speed $v$ towards a huge wall.
Its initial velocity is at an angle of $\theta$ to the normal.
Imagine that the collision is perfectly elastic and the
wall is perfectly frictionless, so the ``angle of incidence equals the
angle of reflection''. What is the magnitude of the momentum change of the ball (final
minus initial)?
Give your answer in terms of the symbols in the diagram.

A student of mass $m_\mathrm{student}=80\,\kg$ stands at rest next to
a block of ice of mass $m_\mathrm{ice}=320\,\kg$, also at rest, on a
frictionless frozen lake.  The student pushes on the block until the
block is moving away from the student at $1.5\,\mps$ (that is, until
$\left|\vec{v}_\mathrm{ice}-\vec{v}_\mathrm{student}\right|=1.5\,\mps$).
What is the total momentum of the student-plus-block system after the
push? That is, after they are both moving?

is sending, by radio transmission, a birthday greeting home every year
