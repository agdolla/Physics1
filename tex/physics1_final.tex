Consider a car driving around a circular banked turn at constant
altitude with the bank set at $15\,\deg$ to the horizontal Draw the
free-body diagram in the case that the car is going around the curve
at exactly the speed such that no lateral friction force is required
at all, and the car neither loses nor gains altitude (it goes in a
perfect, level, circle). That is, draw the free-body diagram for the
frictionless, perfect-driving case.
