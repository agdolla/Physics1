Roughly what is terminal velocity for a 1-liter soda bottle, filled
with soda (or pop or juice or whatever), falling from a tall building?
(From Problem Set 1.)

Consider a stone thrown upwards at an initial upward velocity of
magnitude $10\,\mps$. Plot the vertical velocity (with upwards
positive) as a function of time for the first 2 seconds of its
trajectory. Use a gravitational acceleration of $10\,\mpss$. Label
your axes quantitatively.

We spent time talking about two vectors, $\vec{v}_3$ and $\vec{v}_4$,
which were the velocities of the rock on a no-air-resistance trajectory.
What was wrong with this picture, that we drew?

What is the magnitude $|N|$ of the normal force acting on a package of
mass $M$ sitting on the floor of an elevator that is accelerating
upwards with acceleration magnitude $a$. The elevator is a normal
elevator in a normal building in New York City.
(From Problem Set 3.)

A car is going around a banked turn faster than the speed for which
the bank is designed. Therefore the car is relying on lateral friction
to make the turn!  Draw a free-body diagram for the car, showing at
least the gravitational force, the normal force, and the frictional
force.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
You have a block of mass $m$ on an inclined plane, inclined at an
angle $\theta=15\,\deg$ to the horizontal. The coefficient of friction
is $\mu=0.9$. What is the magnitude of the frictional force on the
block? The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.
You can leave your answer in terms of $\mu$, $m$, $g$, $\theta$, or
whatever you need to deliver a correct answer.
Once again, state any assumptions you need to make.

A package is moving at a horizontal velocity of magnitude $v$ at $t=0$
relative to the floor.  It scrapes to a halt on the floor. How much
heat $Q$ is generated by the friction, from $t=0$ until when the
package comes to rest?

A ball is dropped from a height of about $1\,m$ onto a concrete

A typical adult is holding her or his left arm at a right angle, so
the upper arm is pointing straight down, and the forearm is pointing
horizontally forwards. The hand is oriented palm-up. The arm is
holding a 6 kg grocery bag by its handle in the hand. Draw a diagram
showing the forces acting on the forearm, at roughly the locations
where they are acting.

If you have a potential of the form

the force is zero.

time according to the equation:
\begin{equation}
x(t) = B\,\e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{2}\,t}\,\cos (2\pi\,f\,t + \theta)
\quad ,

a total length of $7\,m$?

A car of mass $M$ is accelerating at acceleration $a$ in the $x$
direction. Its center of mass is a height $h$ above the ground.  What

What is escape velocity from the surface of the Earth? That is, how
fast do you have to move to get out of Earth's gravity?
If you don't remember $G$ or $M$ for the Earth (and you shouldn't remember
those!) then remember that $g = G\,M/R^2$ and the radius of the Earth is
about $6300\,\km$.

just roughly!

Two balls of putty $m$ are fired towards each other in outer space.
They collide and stick perfectly, without losing any putty or
radiating any sound or heat or anything else. Is the final mass blob
of putty created by this collision slightly more than, slightly less
than, or exactly equal to $2\,m$ in mass? And say why, in fewer than
17 words. Make your answer correct to at least first order in
$\beta^2$. That is, the weakly relativistic limit. But I only need
a qualitative answer, no calculation! (From Lecture
