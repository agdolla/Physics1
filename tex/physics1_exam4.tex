You calculated that a pendulum with a period of $2\,\s$ has a length
very close to $1\,\m$. What would be the length of a pendulum with
a period of $8\,\s$? (From Problem Set 7.)

A very thin ladder of length $L$ and mass $M$ leans against a
vertical wall, on a horizontal floor, making an angle of $\theta$ with respect to the
wall. Imagine that there is a large coefficient of friction $\mu$ at the floor such that
the ladder is in static equilibrium, but assume that the wall is effectively
frictionless. Draw a free-body diagram for the ladder, showing all forces acting.
(From Problem Set 8.)

In the equation
$$
m\,\frac{\dd^2 x}{\dd t^2} + c\,\frac{\dd x}{\dd t} + k\,x = 0 \quad ,
$$ what are the units of $c$? (From Problem Set 8.)

A mass $m$ attached to a spring of spring constant $k$ is pulled a distance $X$
from it's equilibrium position. What is the potential energy in the
spring? (From worksheet on oscillations.)

\vfill

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
If you have a potential of the form
$$
U(x) = A\,x^3 - B\,x + C
$$ where $A$ and $B$ and $C$ are positive constants, find a location $x_0$ where
the force is zero. (From the worksheet on potentials.)
