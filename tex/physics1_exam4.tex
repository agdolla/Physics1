Consider an ice cube that is $2\,\cm$ on a side, floating in water, in
normal New York circumstances. Roughly what is the atmospheric
pressure force (in force units) acting on the top face of this cube?
(From Lecture on 2016-11-01.)

A typical adult is holding her or his left arm at a right angle, so
the upper arm is pointing straight down, and the forearm is pointing
horizontally forwards.  The hand is oriented palm-up.  The arm is
holding a heavy grocery bag by its handle in the hand.  Draw a
free-body diagram for the hand-plus-forearm system, identifying all
significant forces acting on it. (From Problem Set 7.)

A modulus $E$ is a stress divided by a strain. What are the units of $E$?
(From Problem Set 8.)

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
A mass $M$ attached to a spring of spring constant $k$ is released
from rest a distance $X$ from its equilibrium position. It oscillates
with amplitude $X$. What is the maximum \emph{kinetic energy} $K_{\mathrm{max}}$ that
this mass ever attains in the future? Assume there is no damping and
it just oscillates. Give your answer in terms of $M$, $k$, and $X$ (or
any subset of these). (From the recitation on oscillations.)

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
If you have a potential of the form
$$
U(x) = A\,x^2 + B\,x + C
$$ where $A$ and $B$ are constants, where is the equilibrium position
$x_{\mathrm{eq}}$?  (From the recitation on potentials.)
