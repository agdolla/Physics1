Due Tuesday (yes, Tuesday) 2016 November 29 at the beginning of lecture.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
What is the most expensive ingredient of a typical Thanksgiving dinner \emph{by weight}.
What is the relevance of this to world history?

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
\textsl{(a)} Sketch orbits of fixed semi-major axis but increasing
eccentricity, from a circular orbit, to one that is close to radial
(eccentricity close to unity).

\textsl{(b)} What is the transfer time for a radial plunge orbit
from the radius of the Moon's orbit down to the surface of the Earth?
Use the period of the Moon's orbit, the relevant  Kepler's law, and
the properties of the unit-eccentricity orbit.

\textsl{(c)} Look up the story of the Moon landing and return.
Do you see any issues there? What's your best explanation of what
happened?
