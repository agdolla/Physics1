This exam consists of two problems.  Write only in this booklet.  Be
sure to show your work.

\section*{Problem 1}

\noindent~\hfill\includegraphics{../mp/pulley_table.eps}\hfill~

In the system shown, the strings are massless and inextensible and the
pulley is massless and frictionless.  There is a small frictional
force $F_\mathrm{f}=\mu\,N$ between block $m_1$ and the table, but
when released from rest, block $m_2$ falls.

\textsl{(a)} Draw complete free-body diagrams for both masses.

\vfill

\textsl{(b)} What is the acceleration $\vec{a}$ (magnitude and
direction) of mass $m_1$?  Give your answer in terms of quantities
shown in the diagram.

\section*{Problem 2}

A major-league baseball pitcher can throw a baseball at about
$100~\mathrm{mi\,hr^{-1}}$.  Estimate the impulse $\Delta p$ given to
the ball by the pitcher.  Make an estimate of the work done $\Delta W$
by the pitcher on the ball during the throw.  Now figure out some way
to compute the average force $F$ applied by the pitcher to the ball.
Does your answer seem reasonable?  \emph{Clearly state your
assumptions, and justify any that are non-trivial.}
