\section*{NYU Physics I---Problem Set 6}

Due Thursday 2016 October 20 at the beginning of lecture.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}\label{elastic}%
Complete the elastic collision problem started in class.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Some kind of standard work-energy problem? Could be the pulley and table problem revisited.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Hanging sign problem

\paragraph{Extra \problemname\ (will not be graded for credit):}%
Re-do \problemname~\ref{elastic}, but now for the left-hand block having
mass $M$ and the right-hand block having mass $m\ll M$; that is, solve
the extreme mass-ratio problem. For initial velocities, use $v$ for
the big block and $0$ for the small block. Then draw the before and
after pictures in the lab and center-of-mass frames, just as you did
in \problemname~\ref{elastic}.
