the one who changes reference frames? (From Lecture on 2016-12-06.)

What is escape velocity from the surface of the Earth? (From Problem
Set 12.)

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
If the Earth were four times less massive than it is, but were still
on a near-circular orbit at its current Earth--Sun distance, how much
longer or shorter would the year be? (From the recitation on orbits.)

What is the spacetime interval between the two events $A$ and $B$?
$$A = (c\,t_A, x_A) = (1\,\m, 3\,\m) $$
$$B = (c\,t_B, x_B) = (7\,\m, 6\,\m)\quad $$
Don't forget your units.
