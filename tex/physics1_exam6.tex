In the twin paradox, which twin ages more? The one on the geodesic, or
the one who changes reference frames? (From Lecture on 2017-12-05.)

What is the speed of a package orbiting on a circular orbit right near
the surface of the Earth? Give your answer in $\mps$. (From Problem Set 11.)

Muons have a half-life of $2\times 10^{-8}\,\s$ in their rest
frame. When they are moving at a speed of $0.99\,c$ through the
lab, what would their lab-frame (that is, time-dilated) half-life be?
(From Problem Set 13.)

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
If the Earth were half as massive as it is, but were still
on a near-circular orbit at its current Earth--Sun distance, how much
longer or shorter would the year be? (From the recitation on orbits.)

\vfill

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
What is the spacetime interval between the two events $A$ and $B$?
$$A = (c\,t_A, x_A) = (1\,\m, 4\,\m) $$
$$B = (c\,t_B, x_B) = (8\,\m, 2\,\m) $$
Don't forget your units. (From the recitation on the interval.)
