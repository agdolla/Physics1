\paragraph{Problem~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Look up the value and units of Newton's constant $G$.
\textsl{(a)}~Find some combination of $G$, the speed of light $c$, and
some (arbitrary) mass $M$, that has units of \emph{length}.
\textsl{(b)}~Evaluate your expression for the mass of the Sun (you
will have to look it up); that is, find the characteristic length
associated with that mass.  Give your answer in units of km.  What is
the physical meaning of this length (approximately)?
