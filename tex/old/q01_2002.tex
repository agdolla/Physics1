\section*{Problem 1}

A car sits at rest until $t=0$, at which time it begins accelerating
in the $x$ direction at $a_x= 2~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$.  At
$t=5~\mathrm{s}$ the car stops accelerating; from $t=5~\mathrm{s}$ to
$t=10~\mathrm{s}$ the car's acceleration is zero.  At
$t=10~\mathrm{s}$ the car begins accelerating at $a_x=
-4~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$ until it comes to a complete stop.  Draw graphs
of acceleration $a_x(t)$, velocity $v_x(t)$ and position $x(t)$,
showing the times, accelerations, velocities, and positions at the
beginning of the acceleration, end of the acceleration, beginning of
the deceleration, and the stop.  Be quantitative where possible.

\section*{Problem 2}

You have seen that the tall buildings in New York have, on their
roofs, huge water towers.  These towers maintain water pressure in the
buildings.  Estimate the number of times you can fill a typical
bathtub before the water tower on a typical tall building is empty.
Assume that it starts out full.  State clearly any other assumptions
you make.
