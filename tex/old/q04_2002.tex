This exam consists of two problems.  Write only in this booklet.  Be
sure to show your work.

\section*{Problem 1}

When an olympic diver walks out to the tip of the diving board, the
tip sags to a new equilibrium position a distance $y_\mathrm{eq}$
below its ``unloaded'' equilibrium position.  Estimate, roughly, this
distance $y_\mathrm{eq}$ using the following fact: When the diver is
standing at the very end of a diving board, he or she oscillates
vertically with a period $T$ of roughly 1~s.  State, clearly,
\emph{all} of your assumptions.  For instance, you might have to
estimate the typical mass $M$ of an olympic diver.

\section*{Problem 2}

\noindent~\hfill\includegraphics{../mp/wheel_on_spring.eps}\hfill~\\
A wheel of mass $M$, radius $R$ and moment of inertia $I$ rolls
without slipping on a horizontal table.  It is attached to a spring of
spring constant $k$.

(a) Do you expect the frequency of oscillations $\omega$ of this
system to be greater than, smaller than, or equal to $\sqrt{k/M}$?
Give an argument.

\vfill

(b) Compute the frequency of oscillations $\omega$.
