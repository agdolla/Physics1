\section*{NYU Physics I---small variations}

\paragraph{\theproblem}\refstepcounter{problem}%
You have a cubic block of ice, $1.000\,\m$ on a side.  By what
fractional amount does its mass decrease if you shave a millimeter off
of it in each dimension (ie, so that it becomes a cubic block of ice,
$0.999\,\m$ on a side)?

Explain why your answer to the above was so close to $3\times
10^{-3}$.  You have two explanations to give, \textsl{(a)}~one from
the point of view of the three operations you did (shave one face,
then the next, then the next), and \textsl{(b)}~one from the point of
view of small variations (write the formula for the volume $V$ in
terms of the side length $\ell$ and differentiate with respect to
$\ell$).

Give a general argument---using calculus---that
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\,(1+\epsilon)^n=1+n\,\epsilon \quad .
\end{equation}

With a calculator, compute the sine of the angle $\theta=0.1\,\rad$.
Now compute the error you make if you use $\sin\theta=\theta$.  Now
compare that error to the quantity $\theta^2/2$ and $\theta^3/6$.  Is
it close to either?

\paragraph{\theproblem}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Now compute the error you make if you use
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\theta\rightarrow 0}\,\sin\theta=\theta-\frac{1}{6}\,\theta^3 \quad .
\label{eq:third}
\end{equation}
Do you think the \emph{next} term in the Taylor series for sine will
be negative or positive on this basis?

\paragraph{\theproblem}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Inside of what angle is the approximation $\sin\theta=\theta$ good to
one percent?  What is this angle in degrees?

\paragraph{\theproblem}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Now square the expression in Equation~(\ref{eq:third}) and compare it
to the second-order expression for cosine:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\theta\rightarrow 0}\,\cos\theta=1-\frac{1}{2}\,\theta^2 \quad .
\end{equation}
Show that this is consistent with the trigonometric identity
\begin{equation}
\sin^2\theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\,\theta)}{2} \quad .
\end{equation}
